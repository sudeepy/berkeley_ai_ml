## Assignment 5.1
In this assignment, I explored the acceptance rates for Bar and Coffee House coupons. Below is a summarization of my findings:

### Bar Coupons
* High frequency bar patrons (4+ times per month) have higher acceptance rates (~1.85x) compared to overall population of drivers who received bar coupons.
* Bar frequency was a high contributing factor to acceptance rate, with other factors having less of an impact (passenger type, marital status, age)
* Higher frequency was positively correlated with acceptance rate, while lower frequency was negaitvely correlated with acceptance rate.

### Coffee House
* Coupon acceptance rate correlates with visiting frequency
* Time of day seems to be a factor, with 10AM and 2PM being higher than the others. This could be related to typical break times for workers
* Passenger type of Friend(s) and Partner have higher acceptance rates
* Destination Type is also a factor, indicating that people with no specific destination are more open to accepting
* Looking at Passenger type, Destination and Time, there seems to be a narrative of people being open to these coupons during casual, social times
* Only some of the identified factors improve the acceptance rate over the baseline
* Specifically, drivers who go to coffee shops frequently and are driving with Partner/Friend passengers at 10AM/2PM have a **very high acceptance rate**
* Given likely limitations of the product and because combining multiple factors reaches diminishing returns, we should focus on time of day rather than passenger type.
* Overall recommendation is to **target coffee coupons to drivers who visit coffee shops at least once a month around 10 AM or 2 PM**.
